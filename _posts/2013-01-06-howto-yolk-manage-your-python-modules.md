Installing pyhton modules is very easy and straightforward. The problem is
keeping them up to date, list the installed modules, etc. For all these tasks
there is Yolk.

Examples:

```
$ yolk -l   # List all installed Python packages  
$ yolk -U   # Checks PyPI to see if any packages have updates available  
$ yolk -a   # List only the activated packages installed
```

Just go to [PyPy page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yolk), download
it and manage your python modules in a pythonic way :)
