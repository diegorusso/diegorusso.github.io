For some years this blog has been written **only in italian**, and as you
know, some time ago I decided to switch it **in three languages**. While I
wrote only in italian, I made many HOWTOs (guess the language?!). The list
below contains **all my italian howtos** (yep, i've translated only the
title).

If you like one of them, tell me.. so **I can translate it for you**. If you
like, you may translate them too :)
