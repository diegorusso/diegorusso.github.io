    Hi Luca, thanks for the trick.
    I tried but it doen't work.. I have this:

    "namefile not overwritten"

    It works only if I drop "-n" option from mv command (too risky!!)

<p>Pretty simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you don't have a *NIX operating system, please skip this post.</li>
<li>Create a script with this content:
<pre>#!/bin/sh<br />
for f in *; do<br />
g=`expr "xxx$f" : 'xxx(.*)' | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]'`<br />
mv -n "$f" "$g"<br />
done</pre><br />
and call it "rename.sh"</li></p>
<li>Give it execution permissions, typing:
<pre>chmod u+x rename.sh</pre><br />
</li></p>
<li>Execute the script from the directory where you have your files to rename</li><br />
</ol></p>
<div>If you have two files, "<em>Foo</em>" and "<em>foo</em>", you'll be notified and <strong>no files will be overwritten</strong>. So, don't worry about that, you won't lose any information. To be sure, try it with a few files in "<em>/tmp</em>" directory.</div></p>
<div>Question? Suggestion? Comment! :)</div></p>
