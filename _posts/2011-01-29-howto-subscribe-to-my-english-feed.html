<p>Hi, I have a question for you. <strong>Do you know what an "RSS Feed" is?</strong> Now you have two choices: <strong>if no, take a look in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">wikipedia</a></strong>. Now, continue only if you know what is it.</p>
<p>I'm waiting...<br />
...<br />
... are you sure you know what is it? :)<br />
...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsTflhrvC4E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />
<em> ... are you sure?</em></p><br />
Well, now that you are (if yes:<strong> already</strong>) enlightened, <strong>what are you waiting to subscribe to my English RSS</strong>? It's very simple.&nbsp;Click on <em>"Subscribe in a reader</em>" or on button in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"SUBSCRIBE TO ENGLISH RSS"</strong></span> section in the sidebar. Once clicked, you will be redirected to my RSS Feed. Now choose a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators">Feed Reader</a> and start to read me in English! :)</p>
<p><strong>Alternatively you can subscribe via email.</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> this site has <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">three</span></strong> RSS Feed, one per language. This feed is and will be only in English.</p>
<p>Simple, no?</p>
<p>Anyway if you have any trouble, comment this post. I'll happy to help you.</p>
