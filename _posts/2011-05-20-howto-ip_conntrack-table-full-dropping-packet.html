<p>I used to manage a server based on linux and once I had this strange message:</p>
<pre>#> ip_conntrack: table full, dropping packet</pre><br />
One of the effects of this message is that you aren't able to make and receive new connections.<br />
To solve that is enough increase <em>ip_conntrack_max</em> value. As first step check the current value typing:</p>
<pre>#> cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max<br />
65536</pre><br />
Now, increase this value typing:</p>
<pre>#> echo 131072 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conntrack_max</pre><br />
Generally the right value of <em>ip_conntrack_max</em> is set to the <strong>total MB of RAM multiplied by 16</strong>. If you have 8GB RAM (8192 MB), the value should be 131072.</p>
