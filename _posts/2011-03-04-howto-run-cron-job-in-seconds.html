  content: Very nice guide! It's very tricky. Anyway do you know some implementation
    of a scheduler such cron that deals with seconds instead of minutes?

<p>If you know what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a> is, you also know that the minimum time to execute a job is a minute. There is a small tip to execute a cron job every X seconds. For example if you need to run a cron job <strong>every 30 seconds</strong> (it's a common case), you can do it adding these lines to crontab:</p>
<pre>* * * * * root sh /path/to/myscript.sh<br />
* * * * * root sleep 30 &amp;&amp; sh /path/to/myscript.sh</pre><br />
Both lines execute the job every minute, but the <strong>second one waits 30 seconds</strong> using "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_(Unix)">sleep</a>" command from bash.</p>
<p>If you have any question, comment this post. :)</p>
