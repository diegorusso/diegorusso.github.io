<p>Usually when someone (nerd) starts to write a new blog, he begin with an "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world">Hello World</a>". I have this blog since January 2007 and I always &nbsp;have been written in italian (my mother tongue).</p>
<p>Some time ago I decided to write in english and so now I do :) For me this post is like the first of a new blog!</p>
<p>Besides I also know the spanish, hence you can find some useful post in this language. You can switch among languages using the menu on the right or putting "/it/" or "/es/" after the domain.. et voil&agrave;, the site changes language! :P</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="{{site.url}}/images/English.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2991" title="English" src="{{site.url}}/images/English.gif" alt="" width="420" height="210" /></a></p><br />
Now I explain rapidly the structure and features of my site:</p>
<ul>
<li>the domain ends with <strong>.it</strong>: yes, i'm Italian but "IT" stands also for Information Technology (like the motto says). In fact i'm going to write post about IT</li>
<li>I'm using <a href="http://wpml.org">WPML</a> (WP multiple language) plugin to manage more languages. So <strong>there will be three feeds</strong>, one per language. Choose what you prefer!</li>
<li>all pages are translated by me, so they <strong>may have errors</strong> (surely they'll have them).</li>
<li>some post (depends by the importance) i could translate <strong>in all three</strong> (or two) languages</li>
<li>in "<a href="http://www.diegor.it/curriculum/">Curriculum</a>" there will be my CV translated in current language</li>
<li>in "<a href="http://www.diegor.it/howtos/">HOWTOs</a>" page there will be all how to that I'll write (obviously in the current language)</li>
<li>in "<a href="http://www.diegor.it/download/">Download</a>".. oh God, you already know that will be in this page!</li>
<li>"<a href="http://www.diegor.it/license/">License</a>" page contains CC 2.5 license</li>
<li>in "<a href="http://www.diegor.it/who-is-diegor/">Who is diegor?</a>" you can find all my data and contacts (and my lovely avatar of course). This page has two sub-page: "<a href="http://www.diegor.it/who-is-diegor/social-networks/">Social Networks</a>" where is my 2.0 side and "<a href="http://www.diegor.it/who-is-diegor/quotes/">Quotes</a>"</li><br />
</ul><br />
So, this blog is an ESL (<strong>English as Second Language</strong>) blog and you (yes, right you!) could fix my errors, suggest or integrate <a href="http://www.diegor.it/howtos/">HOWTOs</a> and whatever you want.</p>
<p>For now, thanks for you patience and.. see you soon! :)</p>
