<p>A public web server could be reached by many http requests with no user agent. Apache can avoid this kind of requests. The configuration is very straightforward:</p>
<pre><Directory /path/to/a/directory><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; SetEnvIfNoCase User-Agent "^-?$" noUserAgent<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Order Allow,Deny<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Allow from All<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Deny from env=noUserAgent<br />
</Directory></pre><br />
In this example Apache ignores all requests without user agent that are directed to <em>/path/to/a/directory</em></p>
<p>Any comments are appreciate.</p>
