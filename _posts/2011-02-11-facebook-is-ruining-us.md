Yep, it's true. Simply look the image below and.. **think**.

Now ask yourself the reason.. **where is the fault?** In Facebook or in people
who use it?

Facebook is a great tool, a great social network, something incredible. You
can use it un several ways: for your business, to enjoy games, to chat
with friends, to look their photos, and many other ways.

But what happens if **you use Facebook in a wrong way?** I can't answer for you,
but **you can do it**. Think how Facebook can improve your life, think about
benefits it can give you and think **how you can use it.**

**Facebook is powerful**. Don't let it ruins you.
