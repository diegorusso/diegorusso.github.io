Now ask yourself the reason.. **where is the fault?** In Facebook or in people
that use it?

Facebook is a great tool, a great social network, something incredible. You
can use it un several ways: for your business, to enjoy with games, to chat
with away friends, look their photos, and many many ways.

But what happens if **you use Facebook in wrong way? **I can't answer for you,
but **you can do it**. Think how Facebook can improve your life, think about
benefits it can give you and think** how you can use it.**

**Facebook is powerful**. Don't let it ruins you.
