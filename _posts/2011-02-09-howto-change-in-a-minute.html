<p>To improve yourself it's enough little changes (less than a minute each one). <a href="http://www.richardwiseman.com/">Richard Wiseman</a> wrote about that in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/59-Seconds-Think-little-change/dp/023074429X">"59 seconds</a>". Below, ten points that italian Wired suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Buy happiness</strong>: money spent on concerts make you happier than those used to buy items</li>
<li><strong>Listen to more classical music</strong>: classical music relaxes you better</li>
<li><strong>Don't waste the Sun</strong>: Sun and warm weather improve your memory</li>
<li><strong>Sit in the right way</strong>: who sits in the right way is more happier than who sits sprawled</li>
<li><strong>Take things easy</strong>: a continuos relaxed gait and a strong handshake improve your mood even in a bad moments</li>
<li><strong>Don't fall in people's traps</strong>: pay attention to people who offer you dark bargain.</li>
<li><strong>Smile more</strong>: if you use humor in stress situations you have 40% less to have a heart attack</li>
<li><strong>Use email <strong>better</strong></strong>: 37% of people lie in phone call, 27% in conversation and only 14% in mail. Use it better</li>
<li><strong>Watch dogs to understand its owners</strong>: to understand a person ask him to talk about his dog</li>
<li><strong>Use the unconscious</strong>: In vital affair, use your unconscious, the answers are hidden into ourselves.</li><br />
</ol><br />
So? What do you think about these suggestions? Do you want add another one? Have you read "59 seconds"?</p>
