Hi, I have a question for you. **Do you know what an "RSS Feed" is?** Now you
have two choices: **if no, take a look in
[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)**. Now, continue only if you
know what is it.

I'm waiting...  
...  
... are you sure you know what is it? :)  
...

  
_ ... are you sure?_

  
Well, now that you are (if yes:** already**) enlightened, **what are you
waiting to subscribe to my English RSS**? It's very simple. Click on
_"Subscribe in a reader_" or on button in the **"SUBSCRIBE TO ENGLISH RSS"**
section in the sidebar. Once clicked, you will be redirected to my RSS Feed.
Now choose a [Feed
Reader](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators) and start
to read me in English! :)

**Alternatively you can subscribe via email.**

**NOTE:** this site has **three** RSS Feed, one per language. This feed is and will be only in English.

Simple, no?

Anyway if you have any trouble, comment this post. I'll happy to help you.
