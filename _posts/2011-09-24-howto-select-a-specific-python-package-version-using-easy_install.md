"[easy_install](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)" installs the latest
version available of a python package. Sometime you need to use a specific
version and you can install an earlier version of the package you need. For
instance, if you need django 1.1.4, you'll type:

    
    
    #> easy_install "django==1.1.4"

  
Pretty simple eh?

Questions, doubts, comments are appreciated :)
