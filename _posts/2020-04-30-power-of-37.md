37 is a "magic" number. Don't you trust me?

1. Pick any digit from **1 to 9**
2. Form a **3 digits number** (eg.: 777, 333, 888, ...)
3. **Sum every digit** of the above number (eg.: 7+7+7, 3+3+3, 8+8+8, ...)
4. Now pick the numer at step 2 and **divide it by** the number at step 3
5. The result is...

**Can you explain why?**

_PS: 37 is also my age today_ :)
