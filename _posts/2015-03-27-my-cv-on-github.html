<p>I've always had my CV versioned. In the early days I used svn and then I moved to git. I had my own private repository but recently I have decided to move it to github. It is written in LaTeX and it uses ModernCV classes.<br />
You can get the pdf from my website/github or you can fork my repo to create your own CV starting from http://github.com/diegorusso/cv</p>
