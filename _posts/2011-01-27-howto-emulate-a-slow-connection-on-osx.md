In Italy, where I live (for now), it's not difficult to "emulate" a slow
connection. Anyway if you want test your new webapp or you want see the
behavior of website with a slow connection, then "speedlimit" is for you. It's
a small application (**preference pane** exactly) that you can find
[here](http://mschrag.github.com/).

The steps are very simple:

  1. download it (from [here](http://mschrag.github.com/))
  2. install it
  3. run it
  4. choose the ports and the sites where you want go slowly
  5. finally choose the slowness of you "emulated" connection
  6. once you have set up everything, press the button "Slow Down"
    
So, don't run!! :)
