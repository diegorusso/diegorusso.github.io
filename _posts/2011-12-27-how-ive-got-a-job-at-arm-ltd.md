It's been long time that I don't write on my blog. I know, I'm bad guy even after
all the pressure from my 2 readers :P  
I waited because this post is particular, special, different from the
others. I was waiting the right moment to write it and I think this
moment has arrived.

I'd like to explain how I've got a job at [ARM Ltd](http://www.arm.com), in
Cambridge (UK). **ARM**, yes the one of microprocessors. :)

The aim is to tell you my experience, what I did, what I passed without any
pomposity. Indeed, the opposite. I'd like that you understand that with a bit
of commitment, goodwill, sacrifices, humility and determination you can also
reach your targets.

_Let's start_.

I'm Diego Russo, 28 years old, Italian, bachelor degree in computer science,
software developer, 5 years of working experience in Italy, passionate of my
work. In one word: **nerd**.

Everything begins on **July, 6th 2011**. Maybe some years before, with a
dream: _to go abroad for working, in a big software firm_. I've never felt
ready and maybe I wasn't last summer. Anyway this is another story. Since
2006, after getting my bachelor, I've started working as software developer in
many projects and companies. Without saying too much, you can [have a look to my
CV]({{site.url}}/cv/) and understand my background ([here my
linkedin profile](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/diegor))

These 5 years in Italy have been enough to see my career grows
slowly. I had great time, interesting jobs, colleagues, challenges.
Economic/financial aspect instead wasn't so satisfactory.

On June 2011, I attended to _Europython_, european conference about
[Python](http://python.org/). In that conference there were european
companies that hired people. Just to explore a bit, I gave them my CVs and I
had immediately informal interviews. After that week, I had phone interviews.

I was saying that everything began on **Wednesday July, 6th 2011**. I was
waiting the call from this Irish company. Besides this, I received 5/6 calls
and as many emails to propose me jobs around the Europe (not in Italy). I
thought... What's happening? Then I remembered that the day before I put my CV
(in english) as PDF on [monster.com](http://www.monster.com). In fact it was
this action to trigger the storm of calls and mails.

My first question that I asked to myself was: **why?** The second one was:
**why not?** I decided to "throw me out" despite my not perfect-english (in
May I passed with merit the PET) and my no experience with phone interviews,
in english at all. I wasn't so unprepared though, because in June I had two
contacts via Linkedin and in that occasion I've "studied" using also a course
sold by  [www.italiansinfuga.com](http://www.italiansinfuga.com/corso-inglese-colloquio-di-lavoro/)
(for italians: I highly recommend it).

I did many interviews, with many companies more or less famous, among Ireland,
UK, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway. Meanwhile I passed two exams at university
and had some personal trouble. Despite all of this, I had determination and I went
on. In fact at the end I had the luxury of a choice: **triple**.

First offer that I received, was as python developer in a company based in
Luxembourg. I had this offer in mid-July, but before to answer it I would see
how my other interviews went. I had to answer to this company before **August,
5th 2011.**

Meanwhile I did 3 technical interviews at ARM, with different people for a
position as **Senior Software Developer in the IT Department**. After these
interviews, my recruiter called me to say that I had to fly to Cambridge on
August 2nd-3rd at the ARM headquarter to do the face to face interview. I
still remember.. I was at home alone and after hung up I said two-word: _"Oh
s\*\*t!"_ repeated many times.

In the meantime I receive another job proposal from Norway that I didn't consider
because I already had an offer, I had to do a face to face interview, I was
having exams. The recruiter insisted and I realised that the job proposal came
from ARM Norway. I asked to myself: "_How many possibilities are there that a
random person that has put his CV on monster.com, he could receive in a
limited time (2/3 weeks) two job proposals for the same random company from two
different random european offices?"_ **Apparently a lot.**

Likelihood apart, after a long chat (**end July**) with ARM Norway, he
decided that I had to do the technical phone interview because I liked him. I
asked him: "_How can I do a phone interview with you if on August 2nd and
3rd I'll be in Cambridge for the face to face interview and within August 5th
I have to answer to the company in Luxembourg? Besides I should ask to ARM in
Cambridge to give me a response in less than 24h."_ He answered: _"On August,
4th"_. And I: _"Actually, there's no faulting in your logic"_. **I accepted.**
After hung up, my reaction was the same of before, maybe worse.

August 2nd comes, I flyed to Cambridge, a chauffeur driver picked me up from
London Stansted and he took me to the hotel. It was hot, very hot. Nervous,
concerned but also excited. **On 3rd I did my interview and I think it went
well** (come on.. it's a joke!!). I explained my situation and I wanted a
response within 24h. After the interview, the chauffeur driver took me to
Stansted and I came back to Rome **arriving at home at 3am.**

**At 7:30am I woke up**, shower, coffee, ready to do the phone interview
with Norway. It lasted 3 hours by phone and offline. Also there I reexplained
my situation and I gave the name of who I talked to in Cambridge in order
to have a feedback about my person. **On August 3rd, in the afternoon I
receive both the offers: from Cambridge and from Trondheim.**

I can't remember my reaction, but I remember that I was very excited! **I had
3 offers, I had a choice. I had opportunities, the ones that I've been dreaming of
for years**

What happened after, like calls, mails, trading and the choice are out of the
scope of this blog post and they are a little bit personal. I think it was the most
difficult choice I have ever made so far. I was changing my life and I did not want
to get it wrong. **I hadn't to fail**. I can say that I'm satisfied with my
choice.

The best ever made. Now I'm in Cambridge at home, writing this post, the post
that I've always dreamt to write. So far I can say, **I didn't get it wrong.**

For any information or question you can leave a comment or write me an email.
I'll happy to answer you :)
