If you are using [**Time Machine**](http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-
macosx/time-machine.html) feature from OSX maybe you need to move data from
you hard disk to a new one avoiding to lose it. There is no official way to do
this, but with some trick you can do it easily. Follow these steps:

  1. make sure both drives (could be also a remote hard disk) are connected;
  2. launch _"Disk Utility"_
  3. in the left column, click on one drive name (NOTE: main drive icon!)
  4. at the right side click on _"restore"_ tab (the last one)
  5. from the left, click and drag the icon of the older hard drive to _"source"_ field
  6. repeat step 5 with the new drive dragging it into _"destination"_ field
  7. best choice is to set _"Erase Destination"_
  8. click _"Restore"_
  9. realax for some hours (**_for 120 GB I waited 5 hours_**).

When the process will finish, new drive has the same name of the old one.
**Rename old drive or give a new name to new drive**. Once you changed the
name open Time Machine settings and choose new drive.

That's it :)
