<p>Gestures have been always very important in communication. They preceded the spoken language and human beings used gestures to communicate with their fellows.</p>
<p>I think that gestures are the oldest way of communication. OK, what about gestures today? Are they still used? <strong>Short answer: yes</strong>. Long answer: yes, but <strong>depends on the country and culture</strong>.</p>
<p>As Italian, I like to show you how we Italians use gestures to communicate with other people. Following there are three images with the most popular Italian gestures.</p>
