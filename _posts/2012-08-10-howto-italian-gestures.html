<p>Gestures have been always very important in communication. They preceded the spoken language and human beings used gestures to communicate with their fellows.</p>
<p>I think that gestures are the oldest way of communication. OK, what about gestures today? Are they still used? <strong>Short answer: yes</strong>. Long answer: yes, but <strong>depends on the country and culture</strong>.</p>
<p>As Italian, I like to show you how we Italians use gestures to communicate with other people. Following there are three images with the most popular Italian gestures.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/images/italian-gestures-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3409" title="italian-gestures-1" src="{{site.url}}/images/italian-gestures-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></a></p>

<p>What do you prefer?</p>
<p>Which one is ambiguous (that has another meaning in you culture)?</p>
<p>What's the funniest?</p>
<p>What's an offence (for you)?</p>
<p>So, now you are aware about Italian gestures and before to plan your trip to Italy, be sure to study Italian gestures! :)</p>
