I've always had my CV versioned. In the early days I used svn and then I moved
to git. I had my own private repository but recently I have decided to move it
to github. It is written in LaTeX and it uses ModernCV classes.  
You can get the pdf from my website/github or you can fork my repo to create
your own CV starting from http://github.com/diegorusso/cv
