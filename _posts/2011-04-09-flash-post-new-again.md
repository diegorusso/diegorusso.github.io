Yesterday I decided to update my site and significant changes are:

  * **English**: main language
  * **WPML -> [Qtranslate](http://www.qianqin.de/qtranslate/)**: plugin to manage translations
  * **Fusion -> [P2 theme](http://p2theme.com/)**: more clean and light
  * **3 Feeds -> 1 Feed**: now there is only one feed (<http://feeds.feedburner.com/diegor>)
  * **Many other things**
