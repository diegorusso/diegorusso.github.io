**What**: Europython conference  
**Where**: Florence, Hotel Mediterraneo  
**When**: from 1st July to 8th July  
**Who**: me and other 750+ nerds, worldwide  
**Why**: we love python!

So Europython is a conference about a great programming language and this
year, like the last year, it was located in Florence and organised by Python
Italia with a wonderful support of www.develer.com. This post doesn't want to
be a story about my Europython but it would be an analysis from the point of
view of attendee. If you are interested on what happened there, you can read
many stories following the [twitter
stream](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23europython). Just for the record I
worked last year to help the company that provided WiFi connection, so I'm a
bit aware about problems related to the organisation of the conference. So
let's start with the analysis of every single thing giving **some personal
hint**

**Location**  
Florence, Hotel Mediterraneo. Nice city, nice venue, close to the river and
not far from the city centre. Big enough to host seven tracks (including two
trainings), and 750+ people. There has been some issue the first day when
there was just a track and all the attendees were split in two big rooms where
the upper one was connected audio/video. For the remaining days all the rooms
have been big enough to host all the tracks: just some track was a bit
overcrowded but the organisers doubled the track more popular. This year there
has been also a "garden" in the rear of the hotel but personally I've never
been there: too hot, no wi-fi (just in a small area).

**Schedule and timing**  
Schedule busy, very busy but with regular break: one in the morning, lunch,
and another break in the afternoon. So good timing. Nothing to say. Maybe yes,
but after.

**Duration**  
I think that organisers thought enough to optimise everything in one week: 5
days of talks and two days of sprint. Actually 4 days of talks because the
first one has been kind of introduction to the conference with the VIP talks.
So the schema is 1 + 4 + 2. Is there anything that the organisers can do to
optimise it? Maybe yes.

**Contents**  
Contents covered many stuff: web, testing, HPC, databases, community, cases,
programming model, projects status, health (yes, health!), frameworks, GPU,
graphics, mobile, future, music, and many others. For the content available
have a look to the schedule <https://ep2012.europython.eu/p3/schedule/ep2012/>  
The first thing that come up to your mind is: "cool! A lot of stuff!" And it
is, I agree. But when you are there, maybe it's different. Something can be
changed, in better obviously.  
Poster session: anyone did use it? Lighting talks: perfect! :)

**Connection and tech things.**  
I don't want to go to the core of the last year problems about the connection,
but the organisers have learnt the lesson. The result is that this year the
connection has been much better stable and faster. There have been problems
(they are everywhere) but solved in a record time. About the connection I can
suggest just something after. Other tech things.. oh yes.. the "help desk":
I've never used it but the idea was great! I hope that people used it and
looking the schedule there was some sold out. iPhone and Android app was very
useful for whom that didn't want to carry on the book.  
Oh yes, how to forget the intranet: I didn't use it but I'm sure that has been
useful for many speaker and for the help desk. Great idea!  
Video and streaming: I think the best techie thing ever. Live streaming and
videos ready to download from the intranet. If you want, [all the videos are
on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/PythonItalia/feed) :) Great job!

**Events**  
Tag cocktails, help desk, pybirra, pyfiorentina, google code jam, prize draw,
pyriddle, sprint: a lot of stuff! Very cool and always something to do. Sure
you didn't get bored.Everything was nice, except "tag cocktails". I didn't
like that many people could come because that didn't have the "pass": this
pass gave you a free cocktail and if you had wanted another cocktail, you
would have paid it. So what's the problem? My solution is to give the free
access to everyone and a free cocktail just to whom had the pass. The terrace
was big enough to host more and more people.

**Food**  
I'm Italian and I care about the food. Good food means good attitude that
helps a lot the progress of the conference (I think). In Hotel Mediterraneo
the food is very good and talking with many of the attendees I had the same
feedback. So congratulations to the hotel. Just a quick note: horrible coffee
but at least we had free coffee at american bar.

**People and VIPs**  
How can  a conference be without interesting people? This year we've got many
of them: [Guido Van Rossum](http://www.python.org/~guido/), [Alex
Martelli](http://www.aleax.it/), PyPy staff and many others key members of
python community. They were there, with you: you could swing by them and have
a chat. It's been incredible, and very nice. I couldn't ask better :)

**Companies**  
This year Europython has seen the presence of many key companies: Spotify,
Google, Red Hat, 10Gen, BitBucket, Python Academy, DemonWare, Enthought,
Gymglish and many others. All of them were there to promote python in their
own company and to hire talented people. For whom looks for a job it's been a
great opportunity. More or less, last year my adventure began with Europython
([read more here]({{site.url}}/2011/12/27/how-ive-got-a-job-at-arm-
ltd/)). You could stop by in front the desk of the company, have a chat, give
your CV, solve the crazy puzzles and take home some nice gadget. I WANTED THE
RED HAT but the only way to have it is working for Red Hat :)  
Oh yes, [Josette](http://www.josetteorama.com/) is a fixed point of
Europython: she sells O'Reilly's book with a great discount.

**Women**  
The double of last year: great improvement! 8% among us were women! Following
[the logic of Marco
Beri](https://twitter.com/taifu/status/220048398764621824), on 2016 there will
be 128% of women! :) Not bad! :P Congratulation also to [Lynn Root for her
hard work](http://www.roguelynn.com/) to bring into the Python community more
women.

**General stuff**  
In this category I put everything that I've forgotten earlier. Welcome pack:
google bag with a lot of brochure, two t-shirts and a MongoDB mug to use it
instead of plastic glasses. All the process to buy the ticket was
straightforward: you could book (If you were fast enough) also the room,
sharing with other pythonistas and book the pyfioretina. Everything online. In
general I've seen many small things that made Europython very nice. At the
moment I can't remember all of them but I promise you that if something come
up to my mind, I'll update the blog post.

**How to improve it the next year?**  
I didn't express myself on Schedule and timing, Duration and contents because
I'd like to doit here, all together. I think that the organisers can improve a
lot the content to give a higher quality. This can affect scheduling, duration
and timing. So far, speakers submitted talks and who bought an early bird
ticket could vote them. I like this, very democratic but too much "anarchic":
not for the voting system but for the content proposed. Too many topics
together with no room for further studies. So why not organize the content in
a different way, organize the content in macro areas, in big topic. Just to
give an example: web, enterprise, mobile, HPC, community, etc. Then every big
topic should have a "path", starting from the basics to reach an advanced
level.  
This way to see the content can change also the scheduling and the duration:
why not having sprint all week from monday to saturday (in background) so we
have a day more of talks and every day give to the attendees the progress of
the daily sprint: "we've solved 3 bugs and implemented 2 new features". **The
big picture of my idea is to organise better content, schedule, and timing.**

I end my post to thank all the organiser (many of them are my friend) for the
wonderful job and see you next year for a better Europython. Great job guys!

And you? How can the Europython be improved the next year? What did you like?
