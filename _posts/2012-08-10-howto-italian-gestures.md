Gestures have been always very important in communication. They preceded the
spoken language and human beings used gestures to communicate with their
fellows.

I think that gestures are the oldest way of communication. OK, what about
gestures today? Are they still used? **Short answer: yes**. Long answer: yes,
but **it depends on the country and culture**.

As Italian, I like to show you how we Italians use gestures to communicate
with other people. Following there are three images with the most popular
Italian gestures.
