Well, well, well.. after a while I'm here again writing a post. This time I
won't write anything techy, well it's related to my job/passion: programming.
Time ago I was asked to do a technical review  of the book that today I'm
going to give away. With this contest I'll give away **three eCopies** of
[Instant Django 1.5 Application Development
Starter](http://www.packtpub.com/django-1-5-application-development-starter/book)

The book explains how to write you first Django-powered application without
spending hours to read documentation and figuring out how to do things. **It
goes straightway to the point: write a fully functional Django-powered
application**.
