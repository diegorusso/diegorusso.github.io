Usually when someone (nerd) starts to write a new blog, he begin with an
"[Hello World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world)". I have this blog
since January 2007 and I always  have been written in italian (my mother
tongue).

Some time ago I decided to write in english and so now I do :) For me this
post is like the first of a new blog!

Besides I also know the spanish, hence you can find some useful post in this
language. You can switch among languages using the menu on the right or
putting "/it/" or "/es/" after the domain.. et voila, the site changes
language! :P

[![]({{site.url}}/images/English.gif)]({{site.url}}/images/English.gif)

  
Now I explain rapidly the structure and features of my site:

  * the domain ends with **.it**: yes, i'm Italian but "IT" stands also for Information Technology (like the motto says). In fact i'm going to write post about IT
  * I'm using [WPML](http://wpml.org) (WP multiple language) plugin to manage more languages. So **there will be three feeds**, one per language. Choose what you prefer!
  * all pages are translated by me, so they **may have errors** (surely they'll have them).
  * some post (depends by the importance) i could translate **in all three** (or two) languages
  * in "[Curriculum](http://www.diegor.it/curriculum/)" there will be my CV translated in current language
  * in "[HOWTOs](http://www.diegor.it/howtos/)" page there will be all how to that I'll write (obviously in the current language)
  * in "[Download](http://www.diegor.it/download/)".. oh God, you already know that will be in this page!
  * "[License](http://www.diegor.it/license/)" page contains CC 2.5 license
  * in "[Who is diegor?](http://www.diegor.it/who-is-diegor/)" you can find all my data and contacts (and my lovely avatar of course). This page has two sub-page: "[Social Networks](http://www.diegor.it/who-is-diegor/social-networks/)" where is my 2.0 side and "[Quotes](http://www.diegor.it/who-is-diegor/quotes/)"
  

  
So, this blog is an ESL (**English as Second Language**) blog and you (yes,
right you!) could fix my errors, suggest or integrate
[HOWTOs](http://www.diegor.it/howtos/) and whatever you want.

For now, thanks for you patience and.. see you soon! :)
