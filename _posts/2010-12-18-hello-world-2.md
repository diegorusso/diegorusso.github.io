Usually when someone (nerd) starts writing a new blog, he begins with an
"[Hello World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world)". I have this blog
since January 2007 and I always have been writing in italian (my mother
tongue).

Some time ago I decided to write in english and so now I do :) For me this
post is like the first of a new blog!

Besides I also know spanish, hence you can find some useful post in this
language. You can switch among languages using the menu on the right or
putting "/it/" or "/es/" after the domain.. et voila, the site changes
language! :P

[![]({{site.url}}/images/English.gif){: .align-center}]({{site.url}}/images/English.gif)

Now I explain rapidly the structure and features of my site:

  * the domain ends with **.it**: yes, i'm Italian but "IT" stands also for Information Technology (like the motto says). In fact i'm going to write post about IT
  * I'm using [WPML](http://wpml.org) (WP multiple language) plugin to manage more languages. So **there will be three feeds**, one per language. Choose what you prefer!
  * all pages are translated by me, so they **may have errors** (surely they'll have them).
  * some post (depends by the importance) i could translate **in all three** (or two) languages
  * in "[Curriculum]({{site.url}}/cv/)" there will be my CV translated in current language
  
So, this blog is an ESL (**English as Second Language**) blog and you (yes,
right you!) could fix my errors, suggest or integrate HOWTOs and whatever you want.

For now, thanks for you patience and.. see you soon! :)
