<ul>
<li>git rebase -i <hash-of-commit-before-the-incorrect-one></li>
<li>In you editor now change 'pick' to 'reword' on the line for the incorrect commit.</li>
<li>Once you have done, save and close.</li>
<li>Now the editor opens again with the message to correct. Do your correction, save and close</li>
<li>git push --force</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p>This method will rewrite the history of your repository. If someone pulled/fetched from the repo between the commit with the wrong message and when you correct it, he/she could have some issues. It would be useful to communicate to anyone involved about your action.</p>
