To improve yourself little changes are enough (less than a minute each one).
[Richard Wiseman](http://www.richardwiseman.com/) wrote about that in ["59
seconds](http://www.amazon.co.uk/59-Seconds-Think-little-change/dp/023074429X)".
Below, ten points that italian Wired suggests:

  1. **Buy happiness**: money spent on concerts make you happier than those used to buy items
  2. **Listen to more classical music**: classical music relaxes you better
  3. **Don't waste the Sun**: Sun and warm weather improve your memory
  4. **Sit in the right way**: who sits in the right way is more happier than who sits sprawled
  5. **Take things easy**: a continuos relaxed gait and a strong handshake improve your mood even in a bad moments
  6. **Don't fall in people's traps**: pay attention to people who offer you dark bargain.
  7. **Smile more**: if you use humor in stress situations you have 40% less to have a heart attack
  8. **Use email better**: 37% of people lie in phone call, 27% in conversation and only 14% in mail. Use it better
  9. **Watch dogs to understand its owners**: to understand a person ask him to talk about his dog
  10. **Use the unconscious**: In vital affair, use your unconscious, the answers are hidden into ourselves.
