<p>When you perform an ssh connection to a remote machine, the 1st time you will be prompted to say 'yes' to authenticate the remote host.<br />
This feature is controlled by "<em>StrictHostKeyChecking</em>" parameter and it is set to yes by default. From security point of view, <strong>this option should be enable</strong> because protect you and your system against trojan horse attacks.<br />
Sometimes you need disabling it temporarily. To disable it you can do via console or via config file.</p>
<p><strong>Via console:</strong></p>
<pre>#> ssh -o 'StrictHostKeyChecking no' username@remotemachine</pre><br />
<strong>Via config file</strong>, adding below line to /etc/ssh_config (OSX) or /etc/ssh/ssh_config (linux):</p>
<pre>StrictHostKeyChecking no</pre><br />
Once you turned it on, you can solve "offending key" deleting it from "<em>~/.ssh/know_hosts</em>" through this terminal command:</p>
<pre># sed -i '19d' ~/.ssh/known_hosts</pre><br />
where 19 is the line containing offending key.</p>
<p>If you have suggestions, troubles or you feel alone, comment this post! :)</p>
