<p>If you have this error when you try to run Eclipse and you don't have any running instance of Eclipse, solve it in this way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <em><strong>"workspace"</strong></em> directory</li>
<li>Inside <em><strong>".metadata"</strong></em> directory, delete <strong><em>".lock"</em></strong> file</li>
<li>Run Eclipse.</li><br />
</ol><br />
Simple, isn't it? :)</p>
