<p>Pretty simple:</p>
<pre>Author.objects.values('surname').distinct()</pre><br />
You have a list of all authors with no duplication.<br />
If you use <em>.orderby()</em> together with <em>.values()</em>, you'll have to specify in the order a field that is in <em>values()</em>.</p>
<p>Any comment or suggestion are appreciate :)</p>
