<p style="text-align: left;">Yep, it's true. Simply look below image and.. <strong>think</strong>.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="{{site.url}}/images/facebook_shit.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3189" title="facebook_shit" src="{{site.url}}/images/facebook_shit.jpg" alt="" width="419" height="744" /></a></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now ask yourself the reason.. <strong>where is the fault?</strong> In Facebook or in people that use it?</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Facebook is a great tool, a great social network, something incredible. You can use it un several ways: for your business, to enjoy with games, to chat with away friends, look their photos, and many many ways.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But what happens if <strong>you use Facebook in wrong way? </strong>I can't answer for you, but <strong>you can do it</strong>. Think how Facebook can improve your life, think about benefits it can give you and think<strong> how you can use it.</strong></p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Facebook is powerful</strong>. Don't let it ruins you.</p><br />
