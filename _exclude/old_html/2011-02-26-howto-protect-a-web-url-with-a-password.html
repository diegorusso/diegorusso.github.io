<p>Today I show you how <strong>to protect with a password a web url</strong>. This can be done in several ways (you can find it in Google) and in this post I use <a href="http://apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache2</a>. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Apache2. Most OS have a preinstalled version (OSX has got)</li>
<li>Create a file named "<strong>.htpasswd</strong>" via "htpasswd":
<pre>#> htpasswd -c /path/to/.htaccess diegor</pre><br />
and when the prompt will ask you the password, type it (twice). The file looks like (in this case the password is like the username -<strong> DON'T DO IT, NEVER!!</strong>):</p>
<pre>diegor:HMAATyF2kQ37E</pre><br />
</li></p>
<li>Put this file to a directory <strong>NOT accessible</strong> to web server. For example, move it above <em>www</em> root directory</li>
<li>Finally create a file named "<strong>.htaccess</strong>" in the directory to protect:
<pre>AuthUserFile /path/to/your/safedir/.htpasswd<br />
AuthGroupFile /dev/null<br />
AuthName EnterPassword<br />
AuthType Basic</p>
<p>require user diegor</pre><br />
</li></p>
<li>Restart Apache and go to you protected url via browser. You can't access until you type your user and password</li><br />
</ol><br />
That's it. If you have any issue, comment this post.</p>
