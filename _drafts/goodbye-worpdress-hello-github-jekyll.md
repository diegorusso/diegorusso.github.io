It has been a while I'm not writing in this blog. I have my reasons but the main one is because I've been busy migrating the whole website from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) to Github. To be more precise is to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
With Github pages you can set up a webiste for every project you have on Github or you can set up a "personal" website (linked to you username.github.io project on github).
The underlying technology is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (yes, written in Ruby... :-/). You need to install it on your computer is you are migrating an existent website to Jekyll or if you want to customise your website even more.
The reasons I move to Gihub Pages are summed in the following video
